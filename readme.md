**Please open all issues with this template on the main [Foundation for Sites](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/issues) repo.**

This is the official ZURB Template for use with [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). We use this template at ZURB to deliver static code to our clients. It has a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with Panini
- Sass compilation and prefixing
- JavaScript concatenation
- Built-in BrowserSync server
- For production builds:
  - CSS compression
  - JavaScript compression
  - Image compression

## Installation

To use this website, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)



### Compile and Run

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `html`, viewable at this URL:

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
