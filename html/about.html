    			<p class="lead text-center">What is Grapplers for Christ Australia? Simply put, We are a community of Christians who grapple.</p>
    			<p>We belong to many academies and combat sports gyms around Australia. We come from many different backgrounds and many different denomonations but we are united by Jesus.</p>
    			<p>What binds us together is our common belief in God (Father, Son, and Spirit), who created all humanity and has expressed his love for us in Jesus Christ.</p>
    			<p><strong>Our Mission is three fold</strong></p>
    			<ol>
    				<li><strong>Love:</strong> We are committed to acting out a positive role within the grappling community as representatives of Jesus. We encouarge all our members to love and serve others in their own clubs regardless of affiliation, rank or experience.</li>
    				<li><strong>Gather:</strong> We meet regularly to explore the Christian faith, life and our culture. We're a community of people who follow Jesus. We come from different backgrounds. We welcome all denominations and skeptics alike.</li>
    				<li><strong>Serve:</strong> We act out our mission in very practical ways by serving those in need, just like Jesus. We train, support and fund projects for children living with poverty. Check out <a href="http://www.akademi-kristus.org/" target="_blank">Akademi Kristus</a> for more details.</li>
    			</ol>

    			<p><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></p>
    			<p>As is expressed in the ancient Nicene Creed of 381 A.D.</p>
    			<div class="row">
    				<div class="creed">
    					<p>We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.</p>
    					<p>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary, and was made man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
    					<p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.</p>
    					<p>Amen.</p>
